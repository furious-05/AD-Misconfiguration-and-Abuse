# üîê Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) - Enterprise CA Security Configuration 6 (ESC15) Abuse Guide

### What is ESC15 (CVE-2024-49019) ‚Äì Arbitrary Application Policy Injection in V1 Templates?

**ESC15**, also known as **"EKUwu"**, is a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-49019) in **Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)** affecting **Version 1 (V1) certificate templates**. Discovered by Justin Bollinger from TrustedSec, the flaw allows attackers to manipulate the **Application Policies** field of a certificate request‚Äîeven when those policies are not defined in the original certificate template.


In this attack, an adversary with **enrollment rights** can request a certificate while supplying:

* An arbitrary **subject name** (like a Domain Admin's UPN)
* A malicious **application policy** (like Client Authentication or Certificate Request Agent)

Although the v1 template might be configured to issue certificates only for specific purposes (e.g., Server Authentication), Microsoft‚Äôs implementation of AD CS **gives preference to Application Policies** (a Microsoft-specific extension) over standard **Extended Key Usage (EKU)** when both are present. This allows the attacker to override the intended use of the certificate.

---


### The Core Issue

When a Certificate Authority (CA) that hasn't been patched (as of November 2024) processes a request using a vulnerable V1 template, it may **blindly accept and embed attacker-supplied Application Policies** into the resulting certificate. This happens even if the template is not configured for those usages, essentially **overriding the intended restrictions**.

For example:

* A Web Server template is typically meant for **Server Authentication only**.
* An attacker can inject a **Client Authentication policy** (OID: `1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2`) into the request.
* If the CA is vulnerable, it will issue a certificate that includes both Server Authentication and Client Authentication‚Äîeven though the template was only supposed to allow the former.
* That certificate can now be used to log in to systems that require **Client Authentication**, potentially allowing **unauthorized access as a domain user or admin**.

---

### Why It Works

* **V1 templates** lack the granular control of newer versions and don‚Äôt separate **Application Policies** from **Extended Key Usage (EKU)** as clearly.
* Windows prioritizes **Application Policies** over EKUs when both are present.
* If a template allows the requester to provide the **Subject Name** (i.e., `CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT`), attackers can also spoof identities, making this especially dangerous.
* The attack **does not require elevated privileges**‚Äîjust access to request certificates from a vulnerable template.

## Lab Environment Setup for Demonstrating ESC15 Exploitation

### Step 1:

First, we have a default web server template with schema version 1. Other templates have version 2, and we cannot downgrade from 2 to 1.


The attacker (authenticated user) must have **Enroll** permissions for the template.

2. The template must allow **Supplied in the request**.

3. The template has a schema version of 1.

#### ESC15 Vulnerability Flags

- EnrolleeSuppliesSubject

-  Schema Version = 1

-  Authenticated Users can enroll

- EKU does not include Client Authentication ‚Äî must override using Certipy with:

```
-application-policies "1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.1"
```
## Exploitation of ESC15 Vulnerability Using Certipy

Requests a certificate for jcharles using the WebServer template with `Client Authentication` EKU, saving it to a .pfx file

```
certipy req -u 'jcharles@furious.local' -p 'complex1@' -application-policies "1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.1" -ca furious-DC01-FURIOUS5-CA -template WebServer -dc-ip 192.168.129.140

```
```
