# üîê Timeroasting

## What is Timeroasting?

**Timeroasting** is a cyber security attack technique that targets **Active Directory (AD) environments**. It allows an attacker to **extract password hashes of computer accounts** from a Domain Controller (DC) using a feature in Microsoft‚Äôs custom implementation of the **Network Time Protocol (NTP)**.

## How It Works

In modern AD domains, Microsoft added an **authentication extension to NTP** to prevent time spoofing. When a domain-joined computer requests the current time from a Domain Controller, the DC includes a **Message Authentication Code (MAC)** in the response. This MAC is calculated using the **NTLM hash of the computer account password** as a key.

The important flaw is:

* The client does **not need to be authenticated**.
* Anyone can send a specially crafted NTP request with a **computer account RID (Relative Identifier)**.
* The server will return a valid time response with a MAC that uses the **targeted computer's password hash**.

In effect, this means an attacker can ask the DC to **generate a salted hash of any computer account password** in the domain ‚Äî without needing any valid credentials.

##  When is Timeroasting Successful?

While the concept is clever, Timeroasting is **only effective under certain conditions**:

| Condition                        | Description                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **Weak or Static Passwords**  | If computer accounts use weak or manually set passwords (e.g., `Welcome1!`), they can be cracked offline. |
|  **Old or Inactive Accounts** | Machine accounts that are no longer active might have passwords that were never rotated.                  |
|  **Cloned or Imaged Systems**  | If multiple machines are cloned with the same password, cracking one gives access to others.              |
|  **Non-Windows Clients**       | Devices like Linux servers or legacy systems might use fixed or simple passwords.                         |

By default, machine passwords are **long (128 characters)** and **automatically rotated**, making Timeroasting ineffective. But in **misconfigured or poorly managed domains**, it becomes a viable attack.


Got it ‚Äî here‚Äôs a more **to-the-point** version of **Part 2: Setting Up the Lab** for your `.md` file:

## Setting Up the Lab

There‚Äôs no full lab setup required to perform Timeroasting.

However, to simulate a vulnerable scenario, suppose an admin manually creates a computer account with a weak password:

```bash
impacket-addcomputer -computer-name 'NewComp$' -computer-pass '!)!@carelesswhisper!(&*' -dc-host furious.local 'furious.local/jcharles:complex1@'
```
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Home-lab/timeroast/Timeroast]
‚îî‚îÄ$ impacket-addcomputer -computer-name 'NewComp$' -computer-pass 'Musselburgh21' -dc-host furious.local 'furious.local/Administrator:complexPassword123'
Impacket v0.12.0 - Copyright Fortra, LLC and its affiliated companies 

[*] Successfully added machine account NewComp$ with password Musselburgh21.
                                                                                                                                                 
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Home-lab/timeroast/Timeroast]
```
This adds a machine `NewComp$` with a **static password**. Such accounts are vulnerable to Timeroasting because the password may be crackable once the MAC is obtained via an NTP request.



## Abusing Timoroast

To extract computer account password hashes using Timeroast, we use this Python script from Secura:[Timeroast](https://github.com/SecuraBV/Timeroast)

```
python3 timeroast.py 192.168.129.140 -o hashes.txt 
```
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Home-lab/timeroast/Timeroast]

Now use the custom cracking script with a wordlist like rockyou.txt:

```
python3 timeroast_cracker.py -H ../Timeroast/hashes.txt -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Home-lab/timeroast/timeroast_cracker]

Using Timeroasting, we successfully recovered a plain-text computer password:

```
Musselburgh21
```

This demonstrates how vulnerable weak or static computer account passwords can be exploited to gain unauthorized access.
